    <h4>Rules from the Admins</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><p><b>Be Kind and Courteous</b></p>
            We're all in this together to create a welcoming environment. Let's treat everyone with respect. Healthy debates are natural, but kindness is required.</li>
        <li><p><b>No Hate Speech or Bullying</b></p>
            Make sure everyone feels safe. Bullying of any kind isn't allowed, and degrading comments about things like race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender or identity will not be tolerated.</li>
        <li><p><b>Respect Everyone's Privacy</b></p>
            Being part of this group requires mutual trust. Authentic, expressive discussions make groups great, but may also be sensitive and private. What's shared in the group should stay in the group.</li>
        <li><p><b>Monotony</b></p>
            We understand the need to share your moments, especially involving PUBG. And we also understand how trends work in big groups. If a post or topic becomes stale, we reserve the right to consider it spam. We generally don't like spammers. So keep it fresh, interesting and entertaining.
        </li>
        <li><p><b>This is not a dating site</b></p>
            People came here to have fun. Subjectively involving PUBG Mobile. If we notice you trying to impede the good course we're trying to run here, by trying to score a spouse or a significant other; in the process thwarting their experience. We'll ban you.</li>
        
    </ul>
